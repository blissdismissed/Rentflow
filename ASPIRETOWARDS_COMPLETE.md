## 📋 Quick Start Checklist

### Step 1: Seed Your Property
```bash
# Edit this file first - add your email on line 16:
open backend/scripts/seed-bromley.js

# Then run (with backend stopped):
node backend/scripts/seed-bromley.js
```

### Step 2: Add Real Photos
The seed uses placeholder images. Replace them with your actual Airbnb photos:

**Get your Airbnb image URLs:**
1. Go to your Airbnb listing
2. Right-click each photo → "Copy image address"
3. Update in database:

```sql
UPDATE properties
SET
    images = ARRAY[
        'YOUR_IMAGE_URL_1',
        'YOUR_IMAGE_URL_2',
        'YOUR_IMAGE_URL_3',
        'YOUR_IMAGE_URL_4',
        'YOUR_IMAGE_URL_5'
    ]::jsonb,
    "featuredImage" = 'YOUR_MAIN_IMAGE_URL'
WHERE slug = 'bromley-mountain-escape-2-balconies';
```

### Step 3: Add Stripe Keys
In `public/booking.html` (line 248):
```javascript
const stripe = Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY')
```

In `backend/.env`:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### Step 4: Test Booking Flow
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `python -m http.server 8000`
3. Visit: `http://localhost:8000/public/index.html`
4. Click Bromley property → Select dates → Book

## 🎯 What Makes Your Listing Different

### Airbnb Listing Title:
"Bromley Mountain Escape w/ 2 Balconies: Hike & Ski"

### Your AspireTowards Description Focus:
Instead of just listing features, you now emphasize:
1. **Family experiences** (kids learning to ski, AT hiking milestone)
2. **Local charm** (small town, neighbors waving hello)
3. **Value proposition** (kitchen saves money, affordable)
4. **Emotional benefits** (creating memories, peaceful retreat)
5. **Personal touch** (small family business, not a corporation)

This creates a **warmer, more inviting** feel compared to typical Airbnb listings!
